Is there a better way to make a component with multiple states?

I'm really pround of the buttons.
For buttons, at first I used [box shadows](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow); they looked great untill I started scaling. Then, after learning that shadows cannot receive percent variables, I got kinda stuck. Untill on one [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24707461/12731017), somebody called an unblured inset shadow is border. I googled [inset circular border](), et voila!

Since there won't be more buttons, I decided to hand-calculate their position instead of using a neat equasion, since I don't want to risk it recalculating a lot.

for sass; used official documentation, but this really helped me
